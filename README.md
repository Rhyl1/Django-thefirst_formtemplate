# First template clone from working Django 1.11.26 template
Welcome reader,

I got this working by cloning the first working template.
& re-introducing env.py, after this installing django 1.11.26 and setting the allowed host 
variables in settings.py to the adress given in the browserpreview window.

and now this workspace is up and running - ready to experiment with the course material.
